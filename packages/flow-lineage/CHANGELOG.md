### BREAKING CHANGES :alert: :alert:

- We have recently addressed a security hotspot that had the potential for Code Injection. In our previous implementation, we were utilizing eval for the node template functionality. As a result, we strongly recommend that you update your existing node template APIs to the latest version.
- By updating to the latest version, you will benefit from the security improvements we have implemented, mitigating the risk of Code Injection vulnerabilities. Please refer (here)[https://github.com/ollionorg/flow-core#script] to update `node-template`.
